# NC News

**Link to the Hosted APP: https://alfarooq-northcoders-news.netlify.app/**

This app consists of a News Article viewing website with Articles, Topics (for filtering articles by topic) and Comments. It allows you sort articles based on certain stats and the order in which they are displayed. There is a hardcoded way to log in, which includes selecting a user, logging in and then being able to comment, upvote and downvote, and delete their own comments (but for the Alfarooq user, it's an administrator of the website so you can use it to delete any comment regardless of ownership.)

**To run this project locally (Vite + React):**

1. `cd` into the desired directory in which you would want to clone this project.

2. Run `git clone https://github.com/AlfarooqAlmenghawi/fe-nc-news` once you're in that directory.

3. Run `npm run dev`. This will create a local hosted link for you to view in your browser, locally. I should function just how it does on the hosted URL.

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)
